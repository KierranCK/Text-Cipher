# Text-Cipher

This text encryption program is based on Caesar's Cipher in which the alphabet is offset by a certain number of positions.

The user is prompted to input some text and then prompted to input a code number (between 1 and 25 inclusive), a higher number of which will increase the offset of the alphabet. This same code number will be required when deciphering the code.

Within the code, there are multiple loops, some of which are embedded within each other, to create menus and allow the user to change from cipher mode to decipher mode.

'Menu' is a reserved word within the program, which allows the user to return to the main menu (or main loop) of the program. Due to this, the word can not be ciphered nor deciphered alone, however, it can be either ciphered or deciphered with at least one other character.

See the comments within the code for a description of the multiple parts and how they function.
